#Week 7

In this week's class, we are talking about differential equations, and how to use Matlab to numerically solve them. DiffEQs describe much of the world around us, and a lot of science and engineering analysis centers around solving them!

To start us off, I have created a live script, so let's take a look. This first script will focus on *ordinary* differential equations.
