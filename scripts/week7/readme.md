# Week 7

In this week's class, we are talking about differential equations, and how to use Matlab to numerically solve them. DiffEQs describe much of the world around us, and a lot of science and engineering analysis centers around solving them!

To start us off, I have created a live script, so let's take a look. This script will focus on *ordinary* differential equations. Numerical methods for partial differential equations are outside the scope of this class, but there are other great classes at OSU on how do to this with Matlab that I can point you to.

Next, I have a relatively challenging [in-class example](student_example1.md) for you. This focuses on numerically solving the equation that governs the harmonic (period) motion of a swinging pendulum. We will take plenty of time for a break for you to work on this.
