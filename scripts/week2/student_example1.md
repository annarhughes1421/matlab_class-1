## In-Class Example 1

You can make 3-d (or higher) matrices in Matlab. Think of a 'cube' of data made up of a series of checker-boards or grids stacked up on top of each other. From an environmental data point of view, you could have gridded temperature data on a daily basis. Here the latitude and longitude values are the 'row' and the 'column' values. And then the 'time' would be the third dimension of your data cube.

* Please create the three dimensional matrix B that has the following values as the first 'time slice.' In the cell below, I show you how to do this. Note that the semi-colon here is essentially a 'new row' command. And note that the square brackets on the right side are required.
$
\begin{bmatrix}
4 & 2 \\
3 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
$

For the second time slice, use the following values:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
6 & 7 \\
5 & 8 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

And, for the third time slice, use the following:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
12 & 9 \\
11 & 10 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
