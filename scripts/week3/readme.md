# Week 3
This week, we are going to discuss a few things that a really important to programming, *regardless* of the specific programming language (Fortran, Python, Matlab, R, and so on...)

## Programming Flow Control
First, we will talk about [flow control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow). In a general sense, flow control has to do with how (in what order, etc.) statements in a piece of code are evaluated. One might think that codes execute in a sequential way (line 1, line 2, and so on) but that is not always the case. 

So, let's start off by opening up [class3_1.mlx](class3_1.mlx). Note that this is a live script, and not a regular m-file.

Next, let's have you do this [example](student_example1.md) exercise before we continue.
