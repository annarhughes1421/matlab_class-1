# Week 6

Ok, so now we are going to turn our attention to some common data-analysis tools. This week, it is all about *parameter estimation*. In other words, how do we fit a variety of mathematical models to our data in order to get a good fit? What does it mean, actually, to be a good fit?

Well, let's start with this [live script](class6_part1.mlx) and find out.

And, once we are done with that, let's take 10-15 min and have you work on an [example](student_example1.md).

Finally, I wanted to provide you with one much more complex example. [This script](noa_regression.m) is from a research project on estimating streamflow in the Gulf of Alaska watershed of southcentral and southeast Alaska. It demonstrates some of the regression tools available in Matlab, which are powerful. We will demonstrate this script in class and talk about the major pieces of it briefly.
