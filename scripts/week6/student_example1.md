# In-Class Example 1

Here is some data:

> x = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20];
>
> y = [1.5904    0.7879    1.7116    1.8912    2.5287    2.8682    3.1552    2.3805 3.3594    3.4725    2.6418    2.7021    3.6023    4.6612    3.5538    4.1705 3.5707    4.7451    3.8691    4.4840];

You are going to hypothesize a relationship $y = x ^ {a}$. In other words, your proposed model has a single unknown parameter, the exponent $a$. Please use tools like *fit*, and *fittype* to write a short script whole goal is to determine $a$. Good luck!!
