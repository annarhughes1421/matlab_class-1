# In-Class Exercise 2
I would like you to construct an array (I suggest you use tables) of information about you and your immediate family (siblings, parents, whoever). Or, just make up information for 3-5 random people. Include columns for:

* Last Name
* 
* First Name
* 
* Year of Birth
* 
* Month of Birth
* 
* Day of Birth
