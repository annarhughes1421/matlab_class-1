## Week 8
This week, we are talking about data. Imagine that we have a bunch of observations of a variable. These could be a time series from a sensor, for example. Before we start using out data, we might like to inspect it to see if it makes sense. Sometimes, we will have data points that do not make sense. This could be due to many things; a sensor error, a human error (for manually recorded data), or others. So, we will talk about how we detect suspect points for potential removal. 

In addition, we may have data which is complex, or noisy, and we might wish to do some filtering of the data in order to help us better focus on the portion of the data that is most relevant to us. 

So, let's start with [this live script](class8.mlx), which will direct us to a few simple in-class examples along the way.
