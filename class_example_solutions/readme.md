These example solutions are provided simply to give *one way* of solving the in-class exercises. Do **not** look at them prior to doing the examples. Why? You just won't learn much. Programming is all about problem-solving for yourself. So, good luck, and *only* review these solutions after you have already attempted the problems on your own, or with a partner.
